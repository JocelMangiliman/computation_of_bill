#This is a program that will compute and display the hotel bill of a customer

#This will ask you to provide number of days to compute the bill.
# Hotel Bill Calculation

# This is the given or the rate of everything to pay
#This is the rate per day
RATE_PER_DAY = 1500
# cost of aircon fee
AIRCON_FEE = 500
# cost of internet fee48
INTERNET_FEE = 300
# cost of  tv fee
TV_FEE = 100
# cost of EVAT
EVAT = 0.12

# Step 1: Accept the value for Number of Days
# ask the number of days from user
num_days = int(input("Enter the number of days: "))

# Step 2: Compute the bill
#this will compute the bill of a person
# this is the formula
amount = RATE_PER_DAY * num_days
# total amount is equals to amount + aircon fee + internet fee + tv fee
total_amount = amount + AIRCON_FEE + INTERNET_FEE + TV_FEE
#tax is equals to total amount X EVAT
tax = total_amount * EVAT
 # then bill is equals to total amount + tax
bill = total_amount + tax

# Step 3: Display the bill
# print the bill
print("Bill =", bill)
